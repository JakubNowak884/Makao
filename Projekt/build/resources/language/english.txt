Rules:

At the beginning of the game, each player put 5 cards into the hand of 52
cards. The first card from the deck is placed in the center of the table.
The object of the game is to get rid of all cards in your hand by playing
them on a stealth card if you both have a matching color or face shape.

Individual cards have the following effects:
Ace: The player requests a color for the next player
Deuces / Threes: The next player draws two / three cards
Fours: The next player takes 1 turn
Jacks: The player demands a piece for the entire turn
Queens: The Queen can be played on any non-functional card that
                 any card can be played on the queen
Hearts / Spades King: The next / previous player draws 5 cards

You can only defend yourself from the function cards by playing
the card with the same function .;
